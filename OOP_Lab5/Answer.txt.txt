Answer:
- The class should implement the Comparable interface is Media class.
- We override the compareTo() method by this way:
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Media media) {
		if(this.cost > media.getCost()) return 1;
		else if(this.cost < media.getCost()) return -1;
		else return (this.title.compareTo(media.getTitle()));
		}
This code is illustrate for the compareTo() method by the cost and title. In the case 2 media have the same cost, it compares the title in the ABC order
- No, only one order is acceptable because there is only 1 function with named compareTo(). For the other order comparing, I think we should create a new method.
- I can override method compareTo() in class DigitalVideosDisc.
